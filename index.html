      <p>
        My dearest love,<br><br>
        As we mark our second year together, I look back at the pages we've written side by side. You've been my muse, my comfort, and my greatest joy. These two years are but the beginning of a tale that I hope spans lifetimes. Thank you for loving me with such grace and warmth. Here’s to our past, our present, and all the unwritten chapters ahead.<br><br>
        Forever yours,
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: right;">— Your Lover, Dan ❤️</p>
